# HealthyMeals AI Design Guidelines Document

**Version:** 1.0 **Date:** August 12, 2025 **Author:** [Your Name/Startup Name] 

### **1.0 Introduction**

- **1.1 Purpose:** To provide UI/UX principles, visual direction, and accessibility standards for the prototype. This guide will ensure a consistent, professional, and user-friendly experience.
    
- **1.2 Design Philosophy: "Healthy, Calm, and Clear"**
    
    - The design should feel organized, stress-free, and focused on well-being. Every design choice should contribute to a sense of clarity and ease for the busy professional.
        

### **2.0 Core UI/UX Principles**

- **2.1 Clarity Over Clutter:** The interface must be minimalist. If an element doesn't serve a clear purpose, it should be removed.
    
- **2.2 Effortless Navigation:** The user's journey should feel like a single, guided conversation. They should never feel lost or unsure of what to do next.
    
- **2.3 Control in the Sidebar, Content in the Main Area:** User inputs and controls will be housed in the sidebar, keeping the main page dedicated to displaying the meal plan and grocery list.
    

### **3.0 User Flow & Interaction Patterns (for Streamlit)**

This section defines how the UI/UX principles will be implemented using standard Streamlit components in a sidebar layout.

- **3.1 Layout: Sidebar for Controls**
    
    - The primary user interaction will happen in the `st.sidebar`. This is where the user will set all their preferences. The main column will be used exclusively for displaying the output.
        
- **3.2 Sidebar Text Wireframe:**

- **3.3 Main Content Area:**
    
    - **Initial State:** When the app first loads, the main area will display a welcome message and a call to action, pointing the user to the sidebar.
        
    - **Plan Display:** After generation, the main area will be populated with the 7-day meal plan, using `st.columns` and `st.expander` for a clean, interactive grid.
        
    - **Grocery List:** The grocery list will replace the meal plan in the main view when requested.
        

### **4.0 Visual Direction**

    - **Accent (Action Orange):** `#FFA500` (Orange) - Used for the primary "Generate" button.
        
    - **Neutral Text:** `#333333` (Dark Gray) - For all body copy.
        
    - **Subtle Gray (Containers/Expanders):** `#F5F5F5` (WhiteSmoke) - For expander backgrounds to create separation.
        
- **4.2 Typography:** Clean, modern, and highly readable.
    
    - **Font Family:** **Poppins** (A clean, geometric sans-serif).

### **5.0 Accessibility (A11y) Requirements**
